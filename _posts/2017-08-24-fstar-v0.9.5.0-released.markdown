On 24 August 2017 we released [F* v0.9.5.0](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/releases/tag/v0.9.5.0).
This is another big release with lots of changes and new features compared to v0.9.4.0.

### Main new features

- Proofs by reification (see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00055))
- A revision of the libraries based on a new formal account of monotonic state (see this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02466))
- Extraction of programs with user-defined effects
- Experimental support for tactics
- [New IDE protocol](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Editor-support-for-F*) and [new IDE features](https://github.com/FStarLang/fstar-mode.el): autocompletion, evaluation, real-time syntax checking, jump-to-definition, type-at-point, etc.
