The F* team is pleased to announce the release of F* v0.9.4.0:
<https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/releases/tag/V0.9.4.0>

This is the culmination of exactly one year of hard work from a very
quickly expanding F* team. We're not very good at keeping precise
change lists, but here are the main highlights of this release:

- Predicative hierarchy of universes with universe polymorphism
- Uniform syntax between expressions and types allowing rich type-level computation
- Dijkstra Monads for Free (https://www.fstar-lang.org/papers/dm4free/)
- Extraction to C via KreMLin (https://github.com/FStarLang/kremlin)
- New parser based on Menhir
- New pretty printer for surface syntax and `fstar --indent`
- Changed default effect to Tot
- Strict positivity check for inductives
- New synatax for inductive type projectors and discriminators
- Better semantics for module open and support for local opens
- Better dependency analysis
- Better error locations for Z3 failures
- Replaced Z3 timeouts with machine independent resource limits
- Cleaned up libraries and examples (a bit)
- Improvements to interactive mode
- Docker builds
- Fixed a ton of bugs ([262 closed GitHub issues](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues?page=3&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%222016-02-02+..+2017-02-02%22&utf8=%E2%9C%93))

Enjoy the best F* release ever!
