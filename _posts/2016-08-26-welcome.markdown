After many discussions, and in the spirit of the [Gallium
Blog](http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/) (where I was a regular), the F* team is
happy to announce the F*-blog! Expect a variety of posts, ranging from technical
digressions about Dijkstra Monads to engineering discussions about parsing
technology, and pretty much anything in between.

One of our stated goals is to make F* more accessible to beginners; this
means making the setup easier, but also writing more documentation, so that
people who are _not_ in the vicinity of the F* team can write programs, too.
We've started an effort on the [wiki](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki);
the goal of this blog is to complement the wiki and make it easy for F*
enthusiasts to keep up with the development; be notified about breaking changes
on the `master` branch, and more generally make the development process more
open.

I expect that this blog will also cover related projects, such as
[KreMLin](https://github.com/FStarLang/kremlin), our F\*-to-C translator, and
[miTLS](https://github.com/mitls/mitls-fstar/), our ongoing implementation of
TLS 1.3 in F\*. Stay tuned! â˜­
