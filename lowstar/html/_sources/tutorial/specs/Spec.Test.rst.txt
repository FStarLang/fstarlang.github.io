Specification test
==================


.. code:: fstar

  module Spec.Test
  

It's really important to put spec tests in a separate module. Putting them
in ``Spec.Bignum`` would mean their encoding in the SMT solver would be fed
every time to Z3, polluting the context and slowing proofs down. Don't do that!


.. code:: fstar

  module S = FStar.Seq
  module Spec = Spec.Bignum
  
  open FStar.All
  
  let test_v_vectors = [
    [ 4020757606ul; 24784186ul ], 106447272348738662;
    [ 1154478784ul; 20791736ul ], 89299827301544640
  ]
  
  let test_v arg: ML _ =
    let s, v = arg in
    if Spec.v (S.seq_of_list s) <> v then
      failwith ("Spec.v is not equal to expected value " ^ string_of_int v)
  
  let test (): ML _ =
    List.iter test_v test_v_vectors
