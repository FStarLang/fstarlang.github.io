/// Example: RingBuffer

module RingBuffer

/// new LowStar.Buffer abstraction, and demonstrates how to separate functional
/// predicates from their low-level stateful counterparts.

/// We define the canonical abbreviations, taking care to shadow ST to make sure
/// we don't end up referring to FStar.ST by accident.
