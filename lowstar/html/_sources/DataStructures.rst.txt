Low* data structure libraries
=============================

Resizable vector
----------------

The ``LowStar.RVector`` module offers a high-level abstraction over regular
mutable buffers that can be resized automatically. This requires the use of a
manually-encoded typeclass of regional elements for reasoning about things being
stored in the vector in case they are allocated.

Linked list
-----------

See the examples section of this manual.
