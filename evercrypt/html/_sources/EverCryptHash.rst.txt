Hashing (``EverCrypt_Hash.h``)
------------------------------

This API is:

- **agile**
- **multiplexing**: portable C (all); SHAEXT (SHA2-224, SHA2-256)
- **stateful**

Possible values for the agility argument (``Hacl_Spec.h``) :

.. literalinclude:: ../../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/Hacl_Spec.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: Spec_Hash_Definitions_hash_alg
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: Spec_Hash_Definitions_hash_alg

Supported values for the agility argument: all

Non-incremental API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``EverCrypt_Hash_*`` functions are **non-incremental** and require the
client to follow this exact state machine:

1. one call to ``EverCrypt_Hash_create_in``
2. one call to ``EverCrypt_Hash_init``
3. any number of calls to: ``EverCrypt_Hash_update`` (passing data **exactly** of
   the right block size for the chosen algorithm) or
   ``EverCrypt_Hash_update_multi`` (passing a multiple of the block size)
4. one call to ``EverCrypt_Hash_update_last`` (data strictly smaller than the
   block size)
5. one call to ``EverCrypt_Hash_finish``
6. one call to ``EverCrypt_Hash_free``

Clients may jump to state 2 at any point before state 6.

This API does not allow feeding more data into the hash function after
``update_last`` has been called, the client must proceed with ``finish`` or
erase the state with ``init``.

.. warning::

  This API is error-prone and is not recommended for unverified clients. We
  advise clients use the incremental API described below.

Incremental API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The incremental hash API wraps the non-incremental API with an internal buffer
(at the expense of an extra indirection) and relieves the client from having to
perform modulo computations and block-size management. Furthermore, the
incremental API allows extracting intermediary hashes without invalidating the
state, meaning clients can keep feeding data into the hash function (at the
expense of a state copy).

Clients can allocate state via ``create_in``. This is a non-faillible function
and as such does not return an error code. This is possible because i) we always
have a fallback portable C implementation available for all algorithms and ii)
we do not yet model allocation failures.

.. literalinclude:: ../../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/EverCrypt_Hash.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_create_in
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_create_in

Clients can feed an arbitrary amount of data via ``update``:

.. literalinclude:: ../../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/EverCrypt_Hash.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_update
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_update

A hash can be extracted at any time by the client without invalidating the
state:

.. literalinclude:: ../../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/EverCrypt_Hash.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_finish
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_finish

Once done, clients should use ``free`` which frees all internal buffers and
underlying non-incremental state:

.. literalinclude:: ../../dist/portable-gcc-compatible/EverCrypt_Hash.h
    :language: c
    :start-after: SNIPPET_START: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_free
    :end-before: SNIPPET_END: EverCrypt_Hash_Incremental_free

.. note::

  There is no incremental HACL* API for hashes, i.e. clients must go through
  agility and multiplexing to enjoy the incremental hash API.
